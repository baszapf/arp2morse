Use python to scan your network for know devices (by MAC address). If a know device is found send a subtle morse signal.

This little project mainly stiches together small bits of code created by different people. A nice introduction to python and morse code can be found at [Morse Code and Dictionaries in Python (with Sound)] (http://thelivingpearl.com/2013/01/08/morse-code-and-dictionaries-in-python-with-sound/) by @cptdeadbones.

Just as [@cptdeadbones] (https://github.com/cptdeadbones/python_morse_code) I use the sound files from [Morse Code from wikimedia commons] (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). He has conviently downloaded all the sound files and made them available to [download in zip-format] (http://temp3.net/thelivingpearl_downloads/morse_sound_files.zip).
